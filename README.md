## What is this?
Is a simple portfolio template for helping photographers/designers/any creative people to show their art on the Internet in a easier way. It's responsive, features cool things like filtering pictures depending on the category (you can check it in the "People" and "Architecture" sections in "Pictures" on the demo), an image comparison slider inside the lightbox (you can check it in the "Editing" section in "Pictures on the demo) and tries (do not take this as 100% compliant as I'm not an expert) to be respectful with the privacy of the users (check the messages in "Contact" and "Videos"). It also implements Open Graph to make it look cooler when people shares it on social networks.

You can host a portfolio like this easily in GitHub pages, and it's free as in free beer!

## What does it use?

 - Bootstrap and Popper for the responsiveness
 - FontAwesome for your social networks icons
 - Google Fonts for a cool font
 - Fancybox for a great lightbox
 - Isotope and ImagesLoaded for a cool layout (In this case, of two columns for each category of pictures, but I made the CSS file really friendly to change to your needs)
 - Image-compare-viewer for the awesome image comparison slider
 - The demo uses images from unsplash, if you're a dev you should try it for your placeholders!
